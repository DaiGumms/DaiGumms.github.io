# Interests

I currently play football on a regular basis in a 5-a-side tournament at Evolution and when in University I played for my course in the Campus League. When I played at under 16 level for my local club, I helped win numerous trophies. My highest sporting achievement was Player of the Year in 2011. I enjoy playing many other sports such as badminton, table tennis and rugby as well as many types of card games.

I greatly enjoy using, developing and modifying electronics, software and video games. The first time I experienced programming was when creating a mod for Minecraft at the age of 15. I taught myself over a period of 6 weeks following many tutorials online and I thoroughly enjoyed the process. This made me confident with Java, Eclipse and Adobe Photoshop which came in very useful while studying for my degree. On top of this I built a couple of cheap and basic PCâ€™s before university to learn more about computer hardware.

I look forward to undertaking a new venture in an effort to acquire the experience of applying my theoretical knowledge to the practical requirements of the job at hand. I consider that this opportunity would greatly enhance my understanding and appreciation of my vocational future and focus my thinking and ambitions clearly and positively.

I am a very sociable person by nature allowing me easily to relate to colleagues and work effectively within a team. During education I associated well with both my mentors and peers and never received a bad report for misconduct. I consider that my sociability and oral communication skills are strengths which should acquit me well in an agile environment. In short, I welcome the opportunity to face new challenges and benefit from them intellectually and personally
