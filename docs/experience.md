## Evolution Recruitment Solutions

*Birchwood, Warrington, England July 2018 â€“ Present*

In my current role I am officially a SQL Developer and Software Tester but in addition to these roles I have taken on a few others. Using my knowledge and experience of Agile development I have pushed forward many changes to our kanban process in the department vastly improving its efficiency. I have taken a large interest in Modern Development Operations including source control using git which I have taken the lead in implementing at Evolution. My goal is to create an automated and controlled deployment structure to both our database and in-house applications to minimise defects going out to our employees and clients increasing the trust they have in the service Evolution provides.

I have been mentored to become an intuitive and experienced SQL developer with knowledge of Database design, Data Warehousing and Reporting in various forms such as Excel and SSRS. Development is carried out using various applications such as Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Data Studio.

At Evolution I am the sole tester and I am responsible for thoroughly testing our applications to make sure that any bugs are ironed out before being provided to employees and clients. I started my role without any experience in software testing and since there was nobody that could provide help, I have had to seek it out elsewhere. I regularly attend meetups to learn and make acquaintances in the testing and quality assurance industries. I am a member and avid user of the Ministry of Testing to learn both broad and intricate testing methods for various types of software. I have also authored a blog about the [North West Tester Gathering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/review-north-west-tester-gathering-meetup-david-morgan-gumm/)

## Nuffield Research Placement
*Cardiff, Wales July-August 2014*

In the summer holidays of 2014, I participated in Nuffield Research placements over a period of 5 weeks in the School of Dentistry in Cardiff University, where I helped contribute to a research project in 'Polymer Therapeutics'.  The experience was fascinating and gave me an insight into a professional research environment. The project and the skills I gained made me eligible to receive a Gold CREST award for which, in addition to my project, I had to present a summary of my work in a conference setting.
